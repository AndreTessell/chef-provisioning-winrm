# chef-provisioning-winrm

Partially working but still a WIP, create action works correctly however destroy will not delete the node object.

Note Windows with Chef provisioning is currently only usable with a hosted/on-premise chef server, chef-zero will not work here. :(

May blow shit up, may not.
